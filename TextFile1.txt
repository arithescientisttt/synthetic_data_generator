  Synthetic Data Generator (SDG) - README

Synthetic Data Generator (SDG)
==============================

The **Synthetic Data Generator** is a powerful Unity-based tool designed to generate high-quality, diverse datasets for machine learning models, particularly focused on one-shot and few-shot learning tasks. Leveraging Unity's robust rendering engine and advanced randomization techniques, this tool enables the creation of realistic and scalable image datasets for various applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

*   **Unity 3D** (tested with version 2021.1 or higher)
*   Compatible operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:
    
        git clone https://github.com/arithescientisttt/synthetic_data_generator.git
    
2.  Open the project in Unity:
    *   Launch Unity Hub.
    *   Open the **Synthetic Data Generator** project folder.
3.  Install any required Unity packages through the Package Manager.
4.  Build the project:
    *   Select your target platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    *   Click on **Build** to compile the application.

Usage
-----

1.  **Run the App**:
    *   On first-time setup, the app will create a default folder on the user's desktop called **PerceptionCaptureData** where all generated datasets are stored.
2.  **Configure Parameters**:
    *   You can adjust lighting, object movement, camera angles, and texture mapping via the app's UI.
    *   Optionally, upload custom textures to apply to specific sections of objects.
3.  **Start Data Generation**:
    *   Use the app to generate datasets based on your configured settings.
    *   Images will be saved automatically in the desktop folder or a custom folder if specified.
4.  **Access Output**:
    *   All generated images and metadata will be available in the **PerceptionCaptureData** folder on your desktop.

System Requirements
-------------------

*   **Operating Systems**: Windows 10+, macOS, Linux
*   **Hardware**: A system with at least 8GB RAM and a GPU that supports Unity rendering for optimal performance.
*   **Unity Version**: 2021.1 or higher
